# Shop-management-system-
This is a simple desktop application for managing a shop's inventory. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to add, view, update, and remove items from a local database.

Features
View Inventory: All shop items are displayed in a clear, sortable table with columns for ID, Name, Price, and Quantity.
Add New Items: Easily add new products to your inventory by filling in the name, price, and quantity fields.
Update Existing Items: Select an item from the table to auto-fill its details into the input fields. You can then modify the price and quantity and save the changes.
Remove Items: Select an item and click the remove button to delete it from the inventory after a confirmation prompt.
Persistent Storage: All inventory data is stored in a local SQLite database file (shop.db), so your data is saved even after you close the application.
User-Friendly Interface: The application is built with tkinter, providing a simple and intuitive interface for managing your shop.
